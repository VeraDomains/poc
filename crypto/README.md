# Crypto lib

This module is basically a copy of the X.509 and CMS implementation in the [Awala core lib](https://github.com/relaycorp/awala-jvm) -- but tweaked to do certain things differently.

This is likely to be fairly representative of what we'll have to factor out into a separate "Relaycorp crypto" library.
