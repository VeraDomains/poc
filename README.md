# Vera's proof of concept

This is a working, throwaway prototype of the core of [Vera](https://vera.domains), an offline authentication protocol incubated by [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech). The purpose of this prototype is to inform the eventual implementation of the protocol by:

- Making sure that there's nothing that would make the implementation impossible or infeasible (e.g., key assumptions that turn out to be wrong, lack of tooling).
- Identifying the libraries, tools and systems that we could leverage in an eventual implementation, as well as the Vera-agnostic components that we'd have to build.
- Getting a sense of the effort required to implement the protocol.
- Understanding the data storage and data processing capacity required by the various components of the system.
